## Global Radio News - Android Widget Guide

This guide explains how to set up a widget on your Android device to access the latest news podcasts from multiple countries without requiring extra interaction.

Many Android RSS widget apps can automatically play audio content from RSS feeds. The combined feed we provide aggregates the latest episodes from all news stations into a single feed, making it perfect for widgets.

### Step 1: Set Up the Combined Feed

1. Deploy the `combined-feed.php` script to your web server
2. Access it via: `https://your-server.com/combined-feed.php`
3. Verify it works by checking that you get an RSS feed with multiple news episodes

### Step 2: Install an RSS Widget App

Install one of these recommended RSS widget apps from Google Play Store:
- **Feedly Widget** - Simple RSS widget with auto-play capabilities
- **RSS Reader Widget** - Customizable widgets for RSS feeds
- **KWGT** - Advanced widget maker with RSS capabilities

### Step 3: Configure the Widget

1. Long press on your home screen and select "Widgets"
2. Find your installed RSS widget app and drag it to your home screen
3. Configure the widget with the URL of your combined feed
4. Set auto-play options if available

### Requirements:
- Tasker app (paid)
- AutoTools plugin (optional, for better widgets)

### Setup:
1. Create a new Tasker Task called "Play All News"
2. Add an HTTP Request action to fetch the combined feed
3. Add Parse XML action to extract audio URLs
4. Add Media Play action for each URL in sequence
5. Create a widget for this task on your home screen

## Option 3: Using the Web App with Android Shortcuts

You can create a direct shortcut to the "Play All" feature:

1. Open the Global Radio News web app in Chrome
2. Switch to the "Latest News" mode
3. Tap the menu (‚ãÆ) and select "Add to Home screen"
4. A shortcut will be created that you can tap to access the app
5. For direct "Play All" access, use this URL format:
   `https://your-server.com/radio-news/?mode=podcast&action=playall`

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Updating
- Check that background data is enabled for the widget app
- Reduce the refresh interval (every 30-60 minutes is recommended)
- Make sure battery optimization is disabled for the widget app

### Audio Not Playing Automatically
- Some Android versions restrict background audio playback
- Try enabling autoplay permissions for the widget app
- Use a dedicated podcast app that supports RSS import instead

## Compatible Podcast Apps

These podcast apps can import the combined feed and offer better playback controls:

- **Podcast Addict** - Import via URL in the "Add Podcast" menu
- **AntennaPod** - Open "Add Podcast" ‚Üí "RSS address" and enter the feed URL
- **Pocket Casts** - Use "Add by URL" in the library section
